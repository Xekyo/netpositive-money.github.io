## Isn't Bitcoin useless anyway?



## I have read somewhere that every Bitcoin transaction is ["Equivalent to the power consumption of an average U.S. household over 22.86 days."](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption). Is that true? Isn't that horrible?

It's true in a similar way that [the lack of pirates is causing global
warming](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikaandersen/2012/03/23/true-fact-the-lack-of-pirates-is-causing-global-warming/?sh=508707043a67).
Yes, this is a valid estimation of Bitcoin mining's energy use divided by a
valid estimation of on-chain transactions, compared to a probably valid
estimation of household energy use.

However, connecting these three figures in this way doesn't yield any insight
beyond shock and awe. That's because Bitcoin's primary value is not as a payment
network, so the number of on-chain transactions is not an interesting metric for
it. This can be seen easily: On one hand the [number of onchain
transactions](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactions.html)
has always been limited --- and that limit has been pretty much hit constantly
since at least 2019. On the other hand, the value of Bitcoin, as well as the
estimated number of its users, has been rising over many orders of magnitude
since 2009. How can this be possible?

  * In recent years, long term storage of value has become Bitcoin's main use
    case. That is, people use it more for storing their savings than for paying
    for goods and services.
  * Its current usage is thus more comparable to gold, which is also rarely used
    in transactions. I have never seen anybody calculate the energy cost of gold
    mining plus handling divided by the number of physical gold shipments.
    Probably because that's as misleading a number as the equivalent in Bitcoin.
  * Just as with gold, there are ways to make even small transactions quickly
    and cheaply with Bitcoin. Most real-world transactions use one of these
    off-chain methods. Probably the most popular today are custodial services
    like exchanges. Sending bitcoin from one customer to another on a service
    like this just requires changing two numbers in their database and is the
    equivalent of gold in a bank changing owners. It's hard to say how many such
    transactions there are, since there are many "bitcoin banks" and their
    numbers are proprietary, but it's safe to say they dwarf on-chain
    transactions by orders of magnitude.
  * Unlike gold, there are methods of transacting Bitcoin off-chain that require
    less trust in intermediaries, such as the Lightning Network or Blockstream's
    Liquid federation. With a growing demand in transactions, such alternatives
    are refined and gain popularity, without this being reflected in the above
    numbers. With the Lightning Network, it's even difficult to estimate how
    many transactions are being performed, since there is no central ledger
    recording them all.
  
Tl;dr: Most people don't value Bitcoin as a payment mechanism, and even if they
were, most payments are not recorded on-chain. So calculating the energy cost of
a transaction is as impossible and nonsensical as it would be for gold.
