# Who should you support?

Of course, that is your decision alone. When we started researching this
decision, however, we found out that it is not an easy one to make. There are
many charities or companies that promise results, and it's hard to verify those
claims. 

Fortunately, we are not the first to have this problem. Indeed, there is
emerging a kind of meta-industry of organisations who evaluate climate change
organisations for efficiency. In a way, this is easier than in other fields of
charity, because the final result should be quite measurable &mdash; CO2
avoided/removed per $. But of course, it isn't quite so simple: there are
probabilities, time frames, side effects, counterfactuals, accountability, and
so much more to take into account. 

We have found a few very promising meta-organisations, and it turns out that
these organisations often agree pretty well on whom they are recommending. Even
so, there is significant churn in those recommendations. This makes sense,
because even if everything a recommended organisation wants to achieve comes to
fruition, one important point on the checklist of the meta-organisations is
being underfunded, and the successful organisations might have enough funding
next year.

There are two major categories we're recommending here. Firstly, there is
classical offsetting, which has pretty established practices, evaluation
criteria like the [gold
standard](https://www.goldstandard.org/our-story/gold-standard-offsetting-guide),
good predictability and &mdash; comparably high prices. That is, offsetting a ton of
CO2 typically costs about $20. It gets a little cheaper sometimes, but can also
go into the thousands, which might be justified by other positive effects (say,
conserving wetlands).

On the other side we have some options that are probably more volatile, in that
it's harder to predict the exact impact, but also much more effective in
expectation, so they aim for removing/avoiding more CO2 per $ invested. Here, a
typical estimate is less than $1 per ton. These are not classical offsetting
plays. Instead, they typically try to influence policy making. The basic thought
here is that you can multiply the impact of your donation by persuading the
public to finance your goal, say, more research into alternative energy, or
enact legislation that benefits the climate. 

Our choices were informed by articles like [this one by Marc
Gunther](https://medium.com/nonprofit-chronicles/which-are-the-most-effective-climate-change-nonprofits-d1083f0a2f02)
which in turn links to meta organisations [Giving
Green](https://www.givinggreen.earth/recommendations) and the [Founder's Pledge
Climate Change Fund](https://founderspledge.com/funds/climate-change-fund). You
might be interested in their [climate change executive
summary.](https://founderspledge.com/stories/climate-change-executive-summary).
Another great alternative for Germans (and hopefully soon Swiss) is the [website of
Effektiv Spenden](https://www.effektiv-spenden.org/effektiver-klimaschutz/), who
also have been inspired by Founder's Pledge but in addition by [Let's
Fund.](https://lets-fund.org/clean-energy/)

## Our recommendations

So who do these researchers recommend? Most of these recommendations are on the
effective (but more speculative) side, just because the numbers promise so much
more bang for the buck here. But we're talking to some classical offsetting
providers as well.

Probably the most recommended in the research we looked at is [Clean Air Task
Force](https://www.catf.us/), a US charity that describes their mission like this: 

> We push the change in technologies and policies needed to get to a
> zero-emissions, high-energy planet at an affordable cost. Imagine a world
> where the energy needs of all humans are met efficiently without damaging the
> atmosphere.

Not only do they have an impressive track record and are seen by many as one of
the most effective climate change charities, we find that their mission aligns
nicely with Bitcoin's ethos.

Very similar in this regard is the [ITIF's Clean Energy Innovation
Program.](https://lets-fund.org/clean-energy/):

> Innovation is central to addressing global climate change while increasing
> economic growth, boosting international competitiveness, and eliminating
> energy poverty. ITIFâ€™s Clean Energy Innovation Policy Program seeks to
> accelerate the transition of the domestic and global energy systems to
> low-carbon resources.
    
The ITIF has even authored a
[report](sources#beyondtheenergytechlash:therealclimateimpactsofinformationtechnology)
that clears up popular myths about IT and climate change and specifically talks
about Bitcoin as well.

Founder's Pledge Climate Change Fund, as well as Effektiv-Spenden also give to
[Carbon180](https://founderspledge.com/stories/carbon180-high-impact-funding-opportunity),
who are specifically about championing carbon removal solutions. 

Finally,
[TerraPraxis](https://founderspledge.com/stories/terrapraxis-high-impact-funding-opportunity)
is featured by the Founder's Pledge Fund, and they are focused on advanced
nuclear power.

## Shut up and take my money!

For most people we recommend just donating through [Founder's Pledge
Climate Change
Fund](https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/partners/founders-pledge-climate-change-fund?utm_source=netpositive.money&utm_medium=site&utm_campaign=bitcoin).
They currently support CATF, Carbon180 and TerraPraxis. The above is a special
link that enables them (via Google Analytics) to track the amount of donations
coming from us so we can then evaluate how much Bitcoiners have contributed.
These donations should be tax-exempt in the US and UK.

For Germans (and maybe other Europeans, though they would probably not get a tax
refund), it's more effective to go through our [special donation
page](https://www.effektiv-spenden.org/spendenaktionen/?cfd=11dfe) at
Effektiv-Spenden, which supports CATF, Carbon180 and the ITIF Clean Energy
Program and Carbon180. 

If you want to support one of the above charities specifically, please let us
know so we can try and build the infrastructure to make that easier &mdash; or
just do it yourself and let us know about it. The same goes if you want a
different organisation or fund that, say, might be tax-free in your country.
